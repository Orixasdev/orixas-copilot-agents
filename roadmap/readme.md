## Introduction

Welcome to the official roadmap for the Orix√°s Copilot Agents. With our foundational agents, **Oxal√°** (The Architect) and **Ogum** (The Executor), now stable and empowering developers, our focus shifts to expanding the pantheon.

This document outlines our strategic priorities and development timeline as we work to cover the entire software lifecycle for Farcaster MiniApps.

## ‚úÖ **Q3 2025: Foundation & Stability**

This quarter was dedicated to solidifying our core offering and ensuring the primary workflow is robust, reliable, and provides a seamless experience from idea to execution.

## üå™Ô∏è **H1 2026: The Winds of Change - Ians√£**

With the ability to plan, build, and deploy, the next logical step is to ensure quality and resilience. The first half of 2026 will be dedicated to the force of nature that is Ians√£.

> **Goal:** Introduce a powerful QA and Security agent to automate testing, find vulnerabilities, and clear the path for robust applications.

-   [ ] **Research & Prototyping (Q1):** Integration with testing frameworks (e.g., Vitest, Playwright) and security audit tools.
-   [ ] **Alpha Release (Q1):** **Ians√£ (The QA Agent)** capable of generating unit and integration tests based on Oxal√°'s plans.

## üåäüåª **The Future Pantheon (H2 2026 & Beyond)**

Our long-term vision is to complete the House of Oracles, creating a truly holistic AI development team.

-   [ ] **Iemanj√° (The Refactor Agent):** The great mother who will cleanse and renew our code. Her focus will be on analyzing technical debt, refactoring legacy code, and improving overall code health.
-   [ ] **Oxum (The UX Writing Agent):** The voice of beauty and clarity. Her focus will be on crafting exceptional documentation, UI copy, and user-facing messages, enriching the final product.
