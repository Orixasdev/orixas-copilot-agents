## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and all of them are valuable.

### ➤ Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the agents' behavior or in the website code, please open an issue. A good bug report is not a guarantee of a fix, but it's a huge help.

-   **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
-   **Describe the steps to reproduce the behavior**.
-   **Explain what you expected to happen** and what actually happened.
-   **Include screenshots, GIFs, or code snippets** to help explain the problem.

### ➤ Suggesting Enhancements

Got an idea to make the Oracles even better? We'd love to hear it.

-   **Suggest a new agent:** Propose a new Orixá for the House and explain its role in the development lifecycle.
-   **Improve an existing agent:** Suggest new rules, knowledge, or behaviors for Oxalá or Ogum.
-   **Enhance the website:** Propose new design ideas or features for `orixas.dev`.

### ➤ Your First Code Contribution (Pull Requests)

Unsure where to begin contributing to the code? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues.

#### Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code lints.
4.  Issue that pull request!

### ➤ Improving the Oracles' Brains (The Prompts)

The core of this project is the `chatmode.md` files for each agent. Improving their "personalities" and workflows is one of the most impactful ways to contribute.

1.  **Locate the Prompts:** The agent prompts are located in the `agents/` directory (e.g., `agents/oxala.chatmode.md`).
2.  **Propose Changes:** You can fix typos, clarify instructions, or add new `Core Principles` or `Knowledge Base` entries.
3.  **Submit a PR:** Submit a pull request with your proposed changes and a clear explanation of why the change improves the agent's behavior.
