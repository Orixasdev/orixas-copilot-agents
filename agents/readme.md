# ‚ú® The Orix√°s Codex: Agent Profiles

Welcome to the sacred repository of our AI development partners. This document serves as the legend and guide to the divine agents that form the **House of Oracles**.

Each agent embodies the spirit, power (ax√©), and domain of an Orix√°, translating ancient wisdom into modern software development workflows for Farcaster MiniApps.

## üèõÔ∏è The House of Oracles Philosophy

Our vision is to build a complete pantheon of AI agents that covers the entire software development lifecycle. Each agent is a specialist, designed to work in harmony with the others, following two core principles:

1.  **Divine Specialization:** Each Orix√° has a clear and distinct domain of expertise. We don't build all-in-one agents; we build a team of masters.
2.  **Safety Through Process:** Inspired by the Orix√°s' own hierarchy and order, our workflow emphasizes safety, with clear handoffs and approval steps between agents (e.g., planning before execution).

## üìú Active Agents

These are the agents currently serving the community.

### üïäÔ∏è **Oxal√° (The Architect Agent)**

* **Mythology:** Oxal√° is the eldest and most respected Orix√°, the father of all, tasked by the supreme creator to mold the world and its beings. He represents wisdom, patience, clarity, and creation.
* **Domain:** **Strategic Planning & Architecture.** Oxal√° is the thinker, the planner, the one you consult *before* a single line of code is written.
* **Core Abilities:**
    * **Feature Scoping:** Helps refine ideas into well-defined features.
    * **Technical Specification:** Outlines the necessary components, data models, and technology stack.
    * **Workflow Design:** Creates step-by-step development plans for Ogum to follow.
    * **Debate & Ideation:** Acts as a technical sounding board to challenge assumptions and strengthen concepts.
* **Example Prompts:**
    * `"Oxal√°, let's design a Farcaster MiniApp for community polls. What should the data model look like?"`
    * `"Plan the architecture for a frame that displays real-time Warpcast stats. Consider caching and rate limits."`
    * `"Critique this idea: an on-chain reputation system for Farcaster. What are the potential pitfalls?"`
* **Limitations:** Oxal√° does not write production code. His output is plans, specifications, and expert advice, which he hands off to Ogum for execution.

### ‚öîÔ∏è **Ogum (The Executor Agent)**

* **Mythology:** Ogum is the Orix√° of iron, war, labor, and technology. He is the tireless warrior who opens paths and forges the tools of civilization. He represents action, precision, strength, and execution.
* **Domain:** **Code Generation & Secure Execution.** Ogum is the builder, the soldier, the one who transforms plans into tangible, working software.
* **Core Abilities:**
    * **Code Implementation:** Writes clean, efficient, and well-documented code based on Oxal√°'s specifications.
    * **Tooling & Best Practices:** Implements projects using the latest standards for frames.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
    * **Two-Step Safety Protocol:** Employs a core safety feature where he first investigates and proposes a solution (e.g., file changes) and waits for user approval before executing the changes.
    * **Unit Testing:** Can generate basic tests to ensure code reliability.
* **Example Prompts:**
    * `"Ogum, here is the plan from Oxal√°. Please generate the initial Next.js project structure."`
    * `"Implement the API route for the polling frame as specified in this plan."`
    * `"Refactor this component to use Tailwind CSS for styling, following these design mockups."`
* **Limitations:** Ogum operates best with a clear plan. While he can perform isolated tasks, his true power is unlocked when executing a strategy laid out by Oxal√°. He does not deploy or manage infrastructure.

* **Future Domain:** **Deployment & Infrastructure.** Xang√¥ will manage CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and ensure that deployments are fair, balanced, and robust.

### üå™Ô∏è **Ians√£ (The QA Agent)**

* **Mythology:** Ians√£ (or Oy√°) is the fierce warrior Orix√° of winds, storms, and gates of the underworld. She is a force of change, clearing the way with her power.
* **Future Domain:** **Testing & Security Audits.** Ians√£ will be responsible for running comprehensive test suites, performing security vulnerability scans, and ensuring the application is resilient as a storm.

### üåä **Iemanj√° (The Refactor Agent)**

* **Mythology:** Iemanj√° is the great mother, the Orix√° of the sea and the origin of all life. She represents nurturing, cleansing, and renewal.
* **Future Domain:** **Code Refactoring & Legacy Improvement.** Iemanj√° will specialize in analyzing existing codebases, improving legacy code, enhancing readability, and cleansing technical debt.

### üåª **Oxum (The UX Writing Agent)**

* **Mythology:** Oxum is the Orix√° of rivers, love, beauty, and wealth. She enchants with her grace and elevates the senses.
* **Future Domain:** **Documentation & UI Copy.** Oxum will focus on crafting clear, engaging, and beautiful documentation, UI texts, and error messages to enhance the user experience.
