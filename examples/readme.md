# ⚔️ The Orixás Forge: A Collection of Examples

> Welcome to the forge of Ogum, where divine plans from Oxalá are transformed into working code. This directory contains a curated collection of ready-to-use Farcaster MiniApps and Frames, all built using the **Orixás Copilot Agents**.

Each example is designed to be a practical, real-world starting point for your own projects.

### Philosophy: Guides vs. Examples

To help you navigate our project, it's important to understand the purpose of each section:

* **`../guides`**: This is the school. Our guides and tutorials teach you the *process*, the workflow, and the philosophy behind using the agents effectively.
* **`/examples`**: This is the gallery. Here you will find finished, functional pieces of code that you can clone, study, and adapt for your own needs.

### The Anatomy of an Example

Every example in the forge follows a consistent structure, allowing you to see not just the final product, but the divine process behind its creation:

└── 01-example-name/
├── app/                # The final, working source code.
├── package.json
├── orixas-artifacts/
│   ├── oxala-plan.md   # The detailed specification from the Architect Agent.
│   └── ogum-log.md     # The key prompts used to command the Executor Agent.
└── README.md           # A local guide on what the example does and how to run it.

## 🔮 Planned Examples

The following examples are on our roadmap to be forged. They will be added progressively.

### 🗳️ Basic Poll Frame
* **Description:** A simple but powerful frame that allows users to vote in a two-option poll and see the results dynamically updated.
* **Demonstrates:** State management across frames, user interaction, and dynamic image generation.
* `Status: Planned 🟡`

### 🖼️ NFT-Gated Content
* **Description:** A frame that verifies if a user owns a specific NFT and only displays exclusive content if they do.
* **Demonstrates:** On-chain data fetching (using APIs like Airstack/Alchemy), wallet address verification, and conditional content rendering.
* `Status: Planned 🟡`

### 📈 Dynamic API Display
* **Description:** A frame that fetches data from an external, third-party API (e.g., weather, crypto prices, Farcaster stats) and displays it.
* **Demonstrates:** Interacting with external APIs, handling asynchronous data, and caching strategies.
* `Status: Planned 🟡`

### 🗺️ Multi-Page Interactive Story
* **Description:** A "choose your own adventure" style frame where each button press leads the user down a different path of a story.
* **Demonstrates:** Complex state management, passing state between frames, and building engaging, multi-step user flows.
* `Status: Planned 🟡`
