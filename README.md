Welcome to **Orix√°s Farcaster**, a suite of highly specialized AI agents designed to supercharge your Farcaster MiniApp development workflow inside VS Code. This project is a tribute to the rich Afro-Brazilian culture, respectfully naming each agent after the Orix√°s, whose energies and domains mirror their function in the software lifecycle.

Our mission is to provide developers with powerful, safe, and methodical AI partners that go beyond simple code generation, acting as true members of your development team.

## The House of Oracles

Our pantheon of AI agents is designed to cover the entire development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and beyond.

### Active Oracles

| | Oracle | Role | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SsCQrYn9/oxala2.png" width="80"> | **Oxal√°** | The Consultant | The great creator, the Orix√° of wisdom and divine architecture. Oxal√° is your architectural advisor, helping you plan features, debate ideas, and providing expert code examples. |
| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MpmFy6ZG/ogun2.png" width="80"> | **Ogum** | The Executor | The master engineer, the Orix√° of iron and technology. Ogum takes the plans architected by Oxal√° and forges them into reality, executing tasks with military precision and safety protocols. |

### Future Oracles (Coming Soon)

The House of Oracles is growing. Your support helps bring these new specialists to life:

-   **Xang√¥ (The Deploy Agent):** The King of Justice who will manage deployments and infrastructure.
-   **Ians√£ (The QA Agent):** The Warrior of Winds who will sweep through your code to find bugs and vulnerabilities.
-   **Iemanj√° (The Refactor Agent):** The Mother of the Sea who will cleanse and renew legacy code.
-   **Oxum (The UX Writing Agent):** The Artist of Communication who will craft beautiful documentation and UI texts.

## üöÄ Installation

Installing the Oracles is a simple manual process that gives you full control over your VS Code configuration.

1.  **Open User Settings (JSON):** In VS Code, open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac), then type and select **"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"**.

2.  **Copy & Paste Configuration:** Copy the complete JSON configuration from the [**Manual Install section on our website**](https://orixas.dev/#installation) and paste it into your `settings.json` file.

3.  **Restart VS Code:** Relaunch your editor to see the new **Oxal√°** and **Ogum** agents in your Copilot chat panel.
